# Conversions [2-36] Base <-> [2-36] Base
## Introduction
Initially this was a university exercise and the main objective was to convert
from base 2 to base 10 and vice versa using strings. Then we were tasked to
include not only base 2 and 10 but all the bases between 2 and 16.
Then I decided to improve it using lists.
Then I decided to expand it 'till base 36.
